#creat network switch 

New-VMSwitch -Name "InternalSwitch" -SwitchType Internal

#nested virtualization

Set-VMProcessor -VMName Hyper02 -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true

#The second option relies on network address translation (NAT). This approach is best suited for cases where MAC address spoofing isn't possible, like in a public cloud environment.

First, a virtual NAT switch must be created in the host virtual machine (the "middle" VM). The following example creates a new internal switch named VmNAT and creates a NAT object for all IP addresses in the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet.

New-NetNat -Name LocalNAT -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix "192.168.100.0/24"

#Next, assign an IP address to the net adapter:

 Get-NetAdapter "vEthernet (InternalSwitch)" | New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.100.1 -AddressFamily IPv4 -PrefixLength 24
